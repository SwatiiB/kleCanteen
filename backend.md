## Architecture Overview

### Main Entry Point and Server Setup
The application's entry point is `server.js`, which:
- Configures Express server and middleware
- Connects to MongoDB and Cloudinary
- Sets up API routes
- Implements error handling
- Starts the server on the configured port (default: 5000)

```javascript
// server.js (simplified)
import express from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';
import 'dotenv/config';
import connectDB from './config/mongodb.js';
import connectCloudinary from './config/cloudinary.js';

// Import routes
import adminRoutes from './routes/adminRoutes.js';
import userRoutes from './routes/userRoutes.js';
// ... other route imports

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// Middlewares
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());
connectDB();
connectCloudinary();

// Routes
app.use('/api/admin', adminRoutes);
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);
// ... other routes

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  const statusCode = res.statusCode === 200 ? 500 : res.statusCode;
  res.status(statusCode);
  res.json({
    message: err.message,
    stack: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? null : err.stack
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Database Connection
MongoDB connection is managed in `config/mongodb.js`:
- Connects to MongoDB using the URI from environment variables
- Provides connection status logging

### API Routes Structure
Routes are organized by resource type in the `routes` directory:
- Each resource has its own router file (e.g., `userRoutes.js`, `canteenRoutes.js`)
- Routes are grouped by access level (public, user, admin, canteen staff)
- Each route is connected to a controller function

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication using `jsonwebtoken`
- Role-based access control implemented through middleware
- Three user roles: admin, user (students/faculty), and canteen staff
- Middleware functions in `middlewares/authMiddleware.js` protect routes based on role

### Middleware Implementation
Key middleware includes:
- `authMiddleware.js`: Authentication and role-based access control
- `uploadMiddleware.js`: File upload handling using Multer
- Error handling middleware in `server.js`

### Error Handling Approach
- Centralized error handling middleware in `server.js`
- Try-catch blocks in controllers with appropriate status codes
- Detailed error messages in development, simplified in production

## Key Features

### User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control
- Three user types: admin, regular users (students/faculty), and canteen staff
- JWT-based authentication with token expiration
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Role-specific middleware to protect routes
- Email validation for institutional emails (@kletech.ac.in)

### Canteen and Menu Item Management
- CRUD operations for canteens and menu items
- Image upload and storage using Cloudinary
- Availability toggling for canteens and menu items
- Canteen-specific menu items
- Category-based organization of menu items

### Order Processing System
- Order creation with detailed item information
- Order status tracking (pending, confirmed, preparing, ready, delivered, completed, cancelled)
- Priority order system with additional fee (â‚¹5)
- Different delivery time estimates based on priority status
- Automatic status transition from 'Delivered' to 'Completed'
- Special instructions and delivery address support

### Priority Order System
- Priority orders for students with exams and faculty with exam duties
- University ID validation against exam ranges
- Role-specific priority reasons
- Additional fee for priority orders
- Faster delivery time estimates for priority orders (5-10 minutes vs 10-20 minutes)

### Exam Management
- CRUD operations for exam details
- Department and semester-specific exams
- University ID range validation for priority orders
- Active/inactive exam status

### Image Upload and Storage
- Local temporary storage using Multer
- Cloud storage using Cloudinary
- Image optimization and transformation
- Secure URL generation
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### Cart Functionality and Persistence
- Database-backed cart storage for authenticated users
- Local storage fallback for non-authenticated users
- Cart item management (add, update, remove)
- Cart synchronization between devices

### Payment Integration
- Razorpay payment gateway integration
- Order creation and verification
- Payment status tracking
- Refund processing
- Secure signature verification

### Feedback and Rating System
- Order-specific feedback and ratings
- Multiple rating dimensions (food quality, service speed, app experience)
- Average rating calculation for canteens
- Staff response to feedback
